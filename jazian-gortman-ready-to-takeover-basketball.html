He spent his days honing his skills at the local gym and playing basketball at every opportunity he got. He attended W.J. Keenan High School, where he was a key player in the school's basketball team. As a junior, Gortman led the Raiders in scoring with an impressive average of 23.1 points per game and was a major contributor to the team's success.</p><h2>Moving to the Professional League</h2><p>In what was to be his senior year at Keenan High School, Gortman made a life-altering decision. He chose to forgo his high school senior season and instead joined the Overtime Elite league. This move was driven by his ambition to prepare for a full-time career in the NBA. Despite missing the camaraderie of his high school team, Gortman embraced the professional environment of the OTE league.</p><h2>Overtime Elite: A New Chapter</h2><p>Overtime Elite, an upstart professional league, offers an alternative path for aspiring basketball players. By joining OTE, Gortman took a significant step towards his dream of making it to the NBA. At OTE, he had the opportunity to train, compete, and learn under the guidance of seasoned professionals.</p><p>The OTE league is based in Atlanta and offers its players a minimum salary of $100,000 per year, along with bonuses, equity shares in Overtime, and revenue from jersey sales, trading cards, and video games. This was a significant incentive for Gortman, who reportedly earned $650,000 in his first year with OTE.</p><h2>Standout Performances and NBA Aspirations</h2><p>In his debut season with OTE, Gortman quickly established himself as a player to watch. He averaged 24.4 points, seven assists, and 6.3 rebounds per game. His energy, athleticism, and leadership skills earned him praise from his coaches and peers.</p><p>Gortman's outstanding performances caught the attention of NBA scouts. Many predict that he will be a top pick in the NBA draft when he becomes eligible. He recently signed an NBA Exhibit 10 Deal, taking him a step closer to his NBA dream.</p><h2>Why Gortman Deserves to be on an Active NBA Roster</h2><p>Gortman's skillset, coupled with his relentless work ethic, make him a deserving candidate for an active NBA roster. His explosive energy, scoring ability, and defensive prowess set him apart from his peers. Moreover, his experience with OTE has prepared him for the professional environment of the NBA.</p><p>His decision to join OTE over traditional college basketball has proven to be a wise one. It has allowed him to focus on his game, develop pro habits, and compete at a high level. He has embraced the professional lifestyle, dedicating himself to constant improvement and learning the nuances of the game.</p><h2>Looking Ahead: A Promising Future</h2><p>Gortman's journey from a high school player to a professional athlete is inspiring. His determination, coupled with his natural talent, makes him a player to watch in the coming years.

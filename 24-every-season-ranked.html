Presented in "real-time," each season of the show followed one day, with each episode showcasing an hour. This action drama featured a Counterterrorism Unit, known as CTU, headed by Jack Bauer. Their mission was to prevent terror attacks from taking place in the United States. This had never been done before, and the show's creativity led to universal acclaim. The show won several awards during its run, including a Golden Globe in 2004 for Best Drama Series.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not every season of the series was popular, however, with some later seasons receiving criticism for the portrayal of villains or reusing plots. The show was criticized for being too violent and glorifying torture, but nevertheless, it rose from disapproval and went on to win a multitude of awards.

With nowhere else to turn, Carter requests the help of CTU to help him stop what could be one of the largest-scale terror attacks in America.</p><p>A continuation of the original series, 24: Legacy, had a 12-episode run that attempted to introduce new characters to the world created in the original 24 series. The shortened season still utilized the "real-time" presentation, but the finale featured a 12-hour time jump due to the shorter length.</p><h2 id=day-6><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Day 6</span></h2><h3 id=premiered-on-january-14-2007>Premiered on January 14, 2007</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/24-day-6.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Set 20 months after Day 5, Jack Bauer is released after being illegally held by Chinese government agents.

As a miniseries, <a href=#><strong>24: Live Another Day</strong></a> featured 12 episodes presented in "real-time," with a 12-hour time jump occurring in the series finale.

With a plot involving long-time character Tony Almeida as an antagonist, Day 7 explored new dilemmas while reusing some plot devices. The show was impacted by the Writer's strike in 2007, ultimately delaying the premiere. Executives at Fox wanted the season to air uninterrupted, which benefited the show in that they were able to map out the entire season beforehand and allow for a better perspective on the production value.

Co-creator, <strong>Joel Surnow</strong> said that he originally wanted to change the formatting in season 2, so each episode spanned 24 hours instead of one hour of real-time, but the idea was shot down.

Critics praised the season for its high concept and the performances from the cast, most notably Kiefer Sutherland.

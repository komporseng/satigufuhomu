Carmen even permitted him to become a member of the school band. At the same time, there was a common misunderstanding about rock and roll music as having a bad impact on teenagers. But his mom was disagreeing with his decision to play the electric guitar. However, as Perez was very interested in learning he learned and began playing electric guitar.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Chris-Perez-when-he-was-a-kid.jpg alt="Chris Perez" width=650 height=812 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2><span id=Chris_Perez_8211_Career_and_Professional_Life>Chris Perez – Career and Professional Life</span></h2><p>Chris Perez went out of his house to pursue his dream career when he was just seventeen years old. At that time, Perez shared his dad’s apartment and was working in a library. In 1986, the guitarist was invited by Tony Lares to get together with his Cousin Shelly Lares’ band. Even though the guitarist did not have any interest in Shelly’s Tejano music, Chris went on to join the band as he was being paid more than by the library. After Tony separated from the band, Chris turned out to be the musical director of the band.</p><p>Chris even co-wrote 3 songs for Shelly’s 1st album in the year 1998. Then, he was advanced by bassist A. B. Quintanilla III of the ‘Selena y Los Dinos’ band to get together with them. He did the same in 1989 as the band’s sounds were more ‘sophisticated and hip’. They eventually came up with various famous albums such as “Entre a Mi Mundo” in the year 1992, “Amor Prohibido” in 1994, and “Dreaming of You” in the year 1995. Chris even worked as the lead guitarist for “Kumbia Kings” from 2003 to 2006 and A. B. Quintanilla from 2001 to 2008.</p><h4>Some more about his career</h4><p>The artist then created a band, “Chris Perez Band” together with Garza, Rudy Martinez, Joe Odeja, and Jesse Esquivel in 2008. ‘Hollywood Records’ signed them and their 1st album “Resurrection” was recorded in Henson Studio. On 18th May 1999, the same album was out which includes various songs like “Best I Can”, “Another Day”, and “Solo Tu”. Luckily, it became the winner of the ‘Grammy Award’ in the category of ‘Best Latin, Rock, Urban or Alternative Album. Sadly, the band was dismissed after coming up with their 2nd album “Una Noche Mas”.</p><p>Chris then worked with Angel Ferrer to create the band, “Chris Perez Project” in 2010.

The couple eventually revealed their love when they were at a Pizza Hut restaurant. Selena’s mom was in support of the couple’s courtship but her dad was against it. After some time, Quintanilla Jr. threw Chris out of the band. In 1992, Chris together with Selena went to Nueces County, Texas. Sadly, an employee of Selena’s boutique, Yolanda Saldivar killed Selena.</p><p>Then, Yolanda attempted suicide, however, she got caught by the police. Then, she got the sentence of life imprisonment.

Chris Perez often uploads images of his kids on social media. Sadly, their marital relationship did not go further and they parted in 2008.

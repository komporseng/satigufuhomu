Teniya, like her brother, is also on her path to establishing herself as a basketball star. She looks up to him as an inspiration and the two of them recently showed the world that they got shared a close bond with each other.</p><p>Learn about her age, job, and her boyfriend in this article. Keep scrolling down to learn everything we’ve discovered on Ja Morant’s sister Teniya.</p><h3><strong>Meet Teniya Morant, Ja Morant Sister</strong></h3><p>Teniya Morant is the younger sister of NBA star Ja Morant playing for the Memphis Grizzlies. Ja and Teniya share a close bond with each other. On Valentine’s Day 2022, Ja gifted his sister a white Jeep Wrangler as an early birthday present, the car she had always wanted. The video which captured Teniya’s reaction was shared by Ja on his Instagram account.</p><p>According to TMZ Sports, Morant and Teniya were hanging out in a parking lot when a brand new white Jeep — with a red bow — pulled up, and her reaction was priceless! Teniya immediately started crying tears of joy … and she gave her brother a big hug before walking over to the whip in disbelief.</p><p>They were born to their parents <a href=#>Jamie</a> and <a href=#>Tee Morant</a>.</p><p>Teniya grew up alongside her brother in Dalzell, South Carolina. She watched her brother Ja and father work tirelessly each day in their homemade backyard court. These countless hours of training at a rugged pace launched Teniya’s brother to the basketball stardom.</p><p>Then, Tee made his daughter the next project.</p><p>In the Crackle’s series Promiseland, Ja’s sister Teniya was one of the interviewees.</p><h3><strong>Teniya Morant Age</strong></h3><p>On 16 February 2022, Teniya Morant turned 17 years old.</p><h3><strong>Teniya Morant Job</strong></h3><p>Teniya Morant is aiming to become a professional basketball player like her brother in the hopes of playing in the WNBA. In an open gym, she tries to compete against the boys in Houston High School, the school she attends. “If I can beat a boy, I can definitely beat a girl,” Teniya said. “Some girls just play basketball for fun. I take basketball seriously.”</p><p>Her father believe that Teniya was easier to train than her brother when he was young. “She would be out in the back working with Ja, but they would take it differently,” Tee shared about his daughter. “If I fuss at Ja, he’d go tell on me [to his mother, Jamie]. Teniya would be like whatever, man. She’d have hers and just brush it off. Ja would hold it for a minute”.</p><p>Unlike Ja, Teniya claimed that she can take constructive criticism from her father. As a junior, she was waiting for scholarship offers from different schools. “It’s almost like the same Ja effect as far as wondering when some scholarship offers or more interest is going to come in,” Tee told ABC24. “But I told her you’ve got to do the same thing, put in the work. It will show”.</p><p>At the end of January 2022, her father pulled Teniya off her high school team midseason to train her instead as he didn’t see any progress in her game. In school, she felt discarded by her coach who was focused on their son. She had also lost her love for school games.</p><p>“I’m not going to lie, I was losing love for the game of playing school ball,” she said. “I felt like there was no hope in me with what was going on there. But for him, my mom, my brother. They all make it known that I can get to where I want to be. I’ve just got to work. They know what’s best”.</p><p>Now, she is training with her father as only one recruiting season is left.</p><h3><strong>Does Teniya Morant Have A Boyfriend?</strong></h3><p>Yes, Teniya Morant is in a relationship.

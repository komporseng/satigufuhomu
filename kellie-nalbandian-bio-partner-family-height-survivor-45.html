This article covers details about her partner, family, height, and more.</p><p>Tag along this bio so you’ll find all that we came looking for.</p><h3><strong>Kellie Nalbandian On Survivor 45</strong></h3><p>Survivor 45 is back for the new season in 2023 and Kellie Nalbandian is one of the 18 contestants that you’ll see compete. She shared with Parade.com that the non-winner from the show she relates to is Kelley Wentworth for her “scrappy, tenacious vibe” and the winner is Parvati for her “ability to be a woman and play aggressively and ruthlessly, but also be charming, be kind of soft, and be that person that people feel drawn towards.”</p><p>Regarding her preparation, Kellie said, “I would come home from a 12-hour shift and be like, “Oh my God, I have to work out.” And I’m on my feet literally all day. I’m pretty strong; I’ve been working out. [Flexed her bicep, then laughs.] I do have to lug people who can’t move in bed around, me and my other 120-pound friend who’s also a nurse dragging people out of the bed. It’s really hard to fit it in for me because I have school and work. But I actually applied originally in January of 2022. So it was sort of in the 43/44 cycle.”</p><p>Speaking about what she values in an alliance partner she added, “I’d like to play with people that I not only trust but also understand their motives. They don’t have to be traditionally predictable — I just have to “get” them and vibe with them! And hopefully, we can have some fun together.”</p><p>Speaking of her greatest accomplishment she added, “Working through the COVID-19 pandemic as a nurse in NYC — it showed me I have a lot more resilience and grit than I thought! I’m also proud of being my nursing school valedictorian and getting into Yale for grad school. I think people really underestimate nurses’ intelligence, but I live to prove people wrong.”</p><p>The veteran reality series’ historic 45th season will maintain the format that has been known as the “new era” over the past few years. Three tribes comprise the initial grouping of 18 players. Over the course of 26 days, they will embark on perilous travels, deal with “mergatory” and rice trades, and engage in a competition for social, tactical, and physical dominance. Their professions range from truck drivers to singers to civil rights attorneys.</p><p>The first returning player of the new period is Bruce Perreault, who was given another shot despite just playing one day in season 44, making seventeen of them new to the game. But regardless of where they are from or how much experience they have, they all want to win the game and be the last one standing when it is over.</p><h3><strong>Kellie Nalbandian Partner</strong></h3><p>Kellie Nalbandian is currently engaged to her partner Gabrielle Bellettieri. They have known each other for more than 11 years now and have been in a relationship for at least 7 years.</p><p>Gabrielle proposed to Kellie in March 2022 on a side of Malibu beach. “The most magical moment ✨I love you endlessly&nbsp;<a class="x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x6umtig x1b1mbwd xaqea5y xav7gou x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz notranslate _a6hd" tabindex=0 role=link href=#>@gbash </a>Gab kept aggressively stating how perfect the day was, should have clued me in 😅 day started with a beautiful hike, ended with a sunset picnic… And she surprised me, not an easy task. Thank you for making this so special for us 💛🌻 7 years in and weathering the most challenging part of my life with me in 2020, never been more sure I want to spend every day with you. Life really just changes in an instant, thank god I was standing behind you in line that day in 2011. ❤️.”</p><p>“30 years of the one and only Gabby B – my soulmate, bestie, and piggyback queen. Happy birthday ❤️ I loved the last 7 birthdays with you. Fearlessly into our 30s- you make me excited for every decade.” On Gabrielle’s birthday in February 2022, Kellie announced. “Thank you for supporting my crazy dreams and adventures, loving everyone with your entire being, knowing how to whip up a sauce without a recipe, and befriending all our waitresses whether they like it or not.❤️‍🔥🌻🥹.”</p><p>In February 2023, Gabrielle turned 30 years old. She is working as a brand manager at Hu Kitchen | Hu Products. She was a marketing manager before that at ClientWise LLC.</p><p>Gabrielle studied at <span>Byram Hills High School followed by </span><span>Binghamton University where she studied business and graduated in 2015.</span></p><h3><strong>How Old Is Kellie Nalbandian?</strong></h3><p>As of 2023, Kellie Nalbandian is 30 years old.</p><h3><strong>Kellie Nalbandian Family</strong></h3><p>Kellie Nalbandian comes from a family of four.

She shared with Parade that she became an EMT when she was 18 years old. Moreover, she was exploring, figuring out if she wanted to go to medical school or what.</p><p>“And then, I watched the nurses that I would come across in the emergency room. They were just the badasses&nbsp;<a href=#>running</a> the show, so I went to nursing school. So it’s been a long time.”</p><p>But the epidemic struck about a year into my nursing job. That occurred in New York City. Therefore, it should go without saying that it was the most demanding and difficult thing Mom had ever had to accomplish in my life.</p><p>Per LinkedIn, Kellie has been a staff nurse at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital since October 2020.

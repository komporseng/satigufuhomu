She has not shared any social media posts that might indicate her current relationship status or affairs. However, she is popular for being in a romantic relationship with&nbsp;Why Don’t We singer Zach Herron. The then-lovers&nbsp;attended the same high school and started dating sometime in July 2018.</p><p>Zach and Kay later went to prom together on 2 June 2019 and photos of this day are still available on Kay’s Instagram account. Then on 8 July, the past lovers went together with their family to Cancun, Kay performing/singing live. Before Zach, Kay Cook was romantically involved with Olivier Mascaradeedit. Their relationship ended in June 2018. Olivier spread a rumor that Zach got her drunk and took advantage, to which Kay responded in a fan DM that it was untrue. She said: “It’s all false it’s kind of sad what Olivier is doing to get attention”. Kay’s ex-lover also claimed that she cheated on him with Zach, but this too, Kay denied.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-68890 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Kay-Cook-posing-for-a-photo-with-Zach-Herron-during-their-prom-2019.jpg alt="Kay Cook" width=650 height=406 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-68890 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Kay posing for a photo with Zach Herron during their prom 2019. Source: Instagram</p><h2><span id=Break-up_with_Zach>Break-up with Zach</span></h2><p>Likewise, on 4 August of the same year, Kay publicly announced that Zach cheated on her. She shared this information over her Instagram story, marking their official breakup, referencing to Zach without stating his name. Kay shared that the incident happened four months ago when Zach was in Hawaii “skinny dipping and kissing her”. Zach tweeted, presumably in response, “Don’t believe everything you hear, seriously hurt” and he later deactivated his Instagram account.</p><p>Daniel also added about the situation over Twitter before deleting and it said, “Don’t believe everything you hear!! There are lots of people in the world out for their gain just be careful who you trust ❤️”. Kay also deactivated her account and announced taking a break from social media. A day later, one of Kay’s former friends, Noelle Ivy, went on an Instagramlivestreamm and elaborated on how she knew Zach and that he admitted to cheating by blocking Kay’s number.</p><h2><span id=Possible_8220Reunion8221>Possible “Reunion”</span></h2><p>However, in a video posted by a fan, Zach explained at one of the meets and greets that he would never “put someone through that”. However, it is rumored that they may be back together even after the mix-up. Zach was seen on one of Kay’s TikToks, which she later deleted and Kay was also seen wearing one of Zach’s hoodies in one of her TikToks.</p><p>Likewise, Kay’s new EP, Idk You, is written and produced by Zach. Throughout this time, Zach has also been liking and commenting on Kay’s Instagram photos. During the 8 Letters summer tour, fans caught photos of Zach and Kay together. This shows that these two supposed past lovers are either back together and keeping it a secret from the public or they are back to being good friends who support each other in their professional endeavors.</p><h2><span id=Kay_Cook_8211_Body_Measurements>Kay Cook – Body Measurements</span></h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-68891 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Kay-Cook-posing-for-a-photo.jpg alt="Kay Cook" width=650 height=812 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-68891 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Kay posing for a photo.

As part of the program, Jauz and Skrillex released the single “Squad Out” the following year. He also had songs released by Spinning Records and Monster Cat. He worked with Diplo to remix Mo’s song “Final Song” at the end of 2016. He released five singles in 2017: The Game, Claim to Be, Alpha, Ghost, and I Hold Still.

The group fled as Williams fired several shots into the darkness, hitting each of them and one fatally.</p><p>Noorland urged the judge adopt a similar starting point of his co-accused of between 9 and a half and 10 years and also pointed to Toilolo’s criminal history in Australia before he was deported back to New Zealand and carried out this offending soon after.</p><p>Toilolo’s counsel, Charles Bean, was unsuccessful at trial in submitting his client didn’t enter the house, with Judge Down reconfirming that it was his footprint that was found on a door.</p><p>Bean asked the judge to come to an end jail term of four years after taking into account his remorse, his youth, and contents of his S27 cultural report.</p><p>However, Judge Down struggled to find any remorse, instead from what he had read, Toilolo had expressed more sorrow for the loss of his friend.</p><p>“None of this would have happened if Mr Toilolo and his mates had not invaded [Williams’] house that night.</p><p>“Toilolo received a gunshot to his abdomen but has made a full recovery. Another person suffered a permanent arm injury, and another a permanent leg injury.</p><p>“It’s plain from the reports that Mr Toilolo is traumatised himself … it doesn’t help to point out that was brought on by their own actions.”</p><p>In jailing Toilolo for seven years, the judge also accepted the Crown’s submission to also hand down a minimum non-parole period of 50 per cent, just like his co-offenders.</p><p>“Frankly, it’s more necessary when you look at the two co-offenders because they did show remorse and showed it properly by pleading guilty.</p><p>“Mr Toilolo has not done so … he has therefore displayed that he is not remorseful and that he presents an ongoing and continuing danger to the public.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/8UlrfAuyq3bUdGPk7xtPbHN6aiI=/16x2/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/CU5UYZLMKC5RUXEXKBQIISNPVY.jpg"><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnm5bEqbXAZqqhp5%2Bptq%2BzjKemZqyZorJuss6rZKygn5rAbsPAq6Rmm5ykwamx0makrqVdqMGquMtmqZ6kmauytHnFq6CgoKSau6q6xmaqqaqZo8Futc2tpmackae4r7HSrGSwoaSdeqS0yKWbq52eZA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./kristen-aguirre.html>&#171;&nbsp;Kristen Aguirre - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Nationality, Facts</a>

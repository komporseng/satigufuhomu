And now, he’s rumored to be dating Camila Mendes!</span></p><p><span>So, is Rudy back in the dating game? Get to know all about his dating life below.</span></p><h3><b>Rudy Mancuso And Maia Mitchell Relationship Details</b></h3><p><span>Rudy Mancuso and Maia Mitchell started their love story in 2015. Thereafter, the duo constantly expressed their love for each other on social media with tributes on special occasions, such as Valentine’s Day, birthdays, and anniversaries.</span></p><p><span>However, Rudy and Maia were pretty low-key. The last we saw them together was on Maia’s IG — to commemorate their fifth anniversary on May 3, 2020 — simply captioned, “5 years.”</span></p><p><span>And now, the actress has even removed all traces of her boyfriend from her social media.</span></p><p><span>As for Rudy, he had no post with his girlfriend since Valentine’s Day in 2020.</span></p><p><span>Also, the two unfollowed each other on Instagram.</span></p><p><span>But the confirmation about their break up didn’t come until October 21, 2021, through Maia’s IG photo (tagged Diana Mantis and Nic Mercardo) captioned, “cuffing season.”</span></p><p><span>For those who don’t know cuffing season is defined by Brides as a phenomenon that occurs in the cold season. It is when single people have the desire to find someone to settle down with during the colder months.</span></p><p><span>Looking back, Rudy and Maia were a pair cherished by many. And not just for their romantic chemistry but also for their compatibility to work with each other. So far, they’ve collaborated on several projects together including Sirens and Magic.</span></p><p><span>“There’s actually not a lot we’ve done together because we’re really not comfortable releasing something unless it’s really true [to us]. And by chance, if that project could be something related to Teen Beach Movie or another sequel…Now that I’m thinking about it, it would be a lot of fun,” Rudy once said.</span></p><p><span>Back then, he also was “excited for the future” with his ex. “Maia was the perfect partner for the project, and the song has since set the tone for many unique projects and collaborations ahead,” Rudy explained.</span></p><h3><b>Rudy Mancuso Girlfriend: Is He Dating After Maia Mitchell Split?</b></h3><p><span>After his split with Maia Mitchell, Rudy Mancuso was seemingly dating Camila Mendes.</span></p><p><span>In November 2022, Rudy and Camila “soft launched” their new romance on IG. In the photo, a bikini-clad Camila shared an embrace with a mystery man as she took their photo in the reflection of a glass door.</span></p><p><span>Later, fans figured that the mystery man was Rudy.</span></p><p><span>“Not the soft launch,” remarked actress Nicole Kang in the comment section. Also, Camila’s </span><i><span>Riverdale</span></i><span> co-star Vanessa Morgan chimed in, “Living your best life, and I’m here for it,” she wrote.</span></p><p><span>Rudy and Camila were last together on Rudy’s directorial debut, the film </span><i><span>Música</span></i><span>. And Camila not only stars as Rudy’s love interest but also serves as executive producer.</span></p><p><span>Announcing her new role in the film, this Brazilian-American actress took to her IG to share, “This one hits different. Stories about Brazilian culture are almost nonexistent in Hollywood, and it’s a shame because it may be the most beautiful culture in the world. @rudymancuso vamo nessa!”</span></p><p><span>Before their alleged romance, Maia also once tweeted “Hi honey!” publicity to Rudy.</span></p><p><span>Now, talking about Rudy’s split with Maia Mitchell, it definitely wasn’t an amicable one. After the breakup, the two removed traces of each other from their social media, and never even publicly spoke about it.</span></p><p><span>However, Rudy didn’t delete videos he made with her on his YouTube channel. Be the reason be monetization or memory, several videos of Mitchell are still up on his channel to this day, some of which date back to as early as July 2016.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The earliest video of Rudy with Mitchell on his channel was titled “The Perfect Date.”</span></p><p><span>For those who don’t know, Rudy’s ex, Maia Mitchell is an Australian singer/songwriter and actress from Lismore, New South Wales. She gained recognition from </span><i><span>The Fosters (2013)</span></i><span> where she plays one of the main roles of “Callie Jacob.”</span></p><p><span>Also, the actress has made her mark on the Disney Channel with appearances in </span><i><span>Jessie </span></i><span>(2011), and </span><i><span>Teen Beach Movie</span></i><span> (2013).</span></p><p><span>Here’s her TikTok @</span><a href=#><span>maiamitchell</span></a><span>.</span></p><h3><b>Did Rudy Mancuso Ever Have A Wife?</b></h3><p><span>Rudy Mancuso was private about his past life. So, we’ve no details on his wife.</span></p><p><span>But as of 2022, he didn’t have a spouse.</span></p><h3><b>Who Else Has Rudy Mancuso Dated In The Past?</b></h3><p><span>As said before, Rudy was private about his past relationships. So, we’ve no idea who that star might have been linked to in the past.</span></p><p><span>But we do know that his ex Maia Mitchel was with Ramy Youssef, the actor, before dating him.</span></p><p><span>Ramy and Maia supposedly began dating in 2012 and went their separate ways in 2014. And like Rudy and Maia, they were lowkey as well — both in public and in the press.</span></p><p><span>However, they were times the two appeared to confirm being together. In 2012, Maia tweened about Ramy, the same year were spotted at a cafe together, and Ramy also posted pics with Maia on his old Instagram account which has since been wiped.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmq62Urnqurc2crKynXZy2s7jFq6CeppRitrR5x55knZmknruoecCfq56qXaKuqq2MpqCtm5iaua150qmjoqxf</p></div><div id=links><a href=./jennifer-grey.html>&#171;&nbsp;Jennifer Grey Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, In Relation, Facts</a>

Moreover, he has amassed more than one million followers, mostly due to audiences liking towards his portrayal of&nbsp;an airhead&nbsp;character named Brick Armstrong. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-606 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p style=text-align:justify>After all, audiences are&nbsp;well known for his famous stints in various episodes. For instance, in one of the episodes of the show, he covers up the word "gay " when asked to cover up slur at the wall of the local LGBT center as part of community service. The episode did shed light on the challenges the<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> gay</a> community faces from the level of stereotypical understanding of the word gay itself.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Interestingly though, life outside of screen hadn't been so significant in the actor's life, at least in the arena of relationship. But as time moved one, some small details started coming forward. See for yourself.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Mysterious Girlfriend, Dating</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Michael had&nbsp;been a very shy and secretive one when it came to sharing details on his love life. For fans, it was hard to believe that despite his fame, cute looks, and blazing muscle packed body, he remained single. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-607 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Delta Goodrem Splits From Boyfriend :-</strong> <a href=# rel=follow>Joins The ‘Single’ Community</a></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p style=text-align:justify>Not that he ever confirmed he was single, and instead, he remained mum about his relationship status. On the other hand, it was improbable that he was single. However, his fans worldwide kept solace in the fact that he wasn't off the market, and his shirtless figure was more than enough to turn in a few eyes.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Interestingly though, in 2018, he did surprise his fans with a hint on his possible girlfriend. On 15th February that year, he shared a picture through his Insta handle featuring a girl ( unfortunately only the hair was visible) looking at a classic painting. Furthermore, he captioned the picture writing "valentine," and this was enough to raise many eyes in the media. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p style=text-align:justify></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Michael Provost's mysterious girlfriend as seen from his Insta post on 15th February 2019 </strong>(Photo:&nbsp;Michael Provost's Instagram)</p><p style=text-align:justify>Yes! It appeared that the Saving Zoe star had a company with him a day before he posted the picture (on Valentine's day). But with more reveal, came more questions. Who was the girl? When did he start dating her? Well, there were no answers to any of these <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-609 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>For now. all that can be speculated is his partner has a knack for art, or perhaps she is an art connoisseur.</p><p style=text-align:justify>On top of that, it's unknown if the artist is still together with her: let alone any news of&nbsp;major developments in&nbsp;their relationship. So, all that's known about his lowkey love life is that Michael didn't spend 2018's valentine's day all by himself. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-611 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2 style=text-align:justify>Age, Parents, Siblings</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Michael's( height of&nbsp;5 feet &&nbsp;8 inches i,e,1.73&nbsp;meters )date of birth as per verified records falls on 24th January 1998, whereas his birthplace is Atlanta, Georgia.

When the 21-year-old star, starting showing his enthusiasm for acting, his father and mother remained very supportive of him. Moreover, to support his acting dreams, his parents moved to Los Angeles, where he had better prospects as an artist.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Talking about his siblings, the TV icon has four brothers altogether, and he&nbsp;is the third eldest among them.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Movies</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Michael has mostly stuck to working for TV shows, but that doesn't mean he hasn't been involved in movie projects yet.

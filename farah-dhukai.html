However, her earning source is her profession, which mainly she earns through her make-up videos. And, as we know she is also a social media star, hence she has millions of fans on her media accounts. Also, being a businesswoman, she earns a good amount of money from her business.</p><h2><span id=Career>Career</span></h2><p>During the summer of 2000, entering ninth grade, Farah, developing a stronger bond with her older sister, started borrowing a lot of her clothes and using her makeup. In the year 2010, she came across Michelle Phan on YouTube. Then, she started watching her makeup tutorials and admired what she was doing.</p><p>She launched her own YouTube channel on June 5, 2010. However, she did not feel comfortable posting any of her videos as she did not feel confident enough. Eventually, she posted her first video titled “How to get Long Shiny Healthy Hair! — My Haircare Routine!” to her channel on February 24, 2011.</p><p>Further, as her channel grew, she began receiving messages of inspiration from her audience, telling her that she changed her life. And, it helped push her to continue making videos consistently. Moreover, in August 2016, Farah left YouTube and started posting more often on her Instagram account.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-135702 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Farah-Dhukai-YouTube.jpg alt="Farah Dhukai" width=650 height=365 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-135702 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Farah Dhukai in one of her YouTube videos.

Also, she said she cared too much about her abnormally low numbers and, as a result, felt like people did not like her videos anymore. And as a result, she took to Instagram because those videos were getting a lot more engagement.</p><p>However, she posted a video announcing her comeback on YouTube in August 2017 and vowed to upload one video every week to her channel. Similarly, in late 2015, Farah began a website called Farsali. However, her goal was to create a platform that bridged the gap between makeup and skincare.</p><h2><span id=Personal_Life>Personal Life</span></h2><p>Farah is married to <strong>Sal Ali.</strong> They got married on October 2, 2011. They first met through a mutual friend. On November 5, 2020, she revealed her pregnancy to the public by uploading a video on YouTube and welcomed their daughter Maya.

And although they have been dating for over two years, Alex has yet to appear on Nathalie’s Instagram.</p><p>Of course, the two of them have not exactly been hiding. In July 2018, for example, Nathalie and Alex were spotted in Ischia holding hands, enjoying the city of Ischia and having a good time overall.</p><p>Then in July 2021, the cute couple was spotted in Notting Hill, London for what appeared to be a very casual stroll.
